# Weather-Journal App Project
An asynchronous app to allow the user to access information including the live and future weather conditions and temperature of a location in the world, by imputing a city name. 
This app uses web APIs to access this data, then dynamically updates the UI with this information. 

Start the app using the commands:
yarn build-prod
yarn build-dev
yarn start

Enter and city and your trip dates

Extend your project:
- App allows user to include end date and displays trip length
- App pulls image from Pixabay API to always provide an image even when location has none
-
